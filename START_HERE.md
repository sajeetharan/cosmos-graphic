# 🚀 Getting Started - READ THIS FIRST!

Welcome! Your Azure Cosmos DB Visual Storybook is ready to go. Follow these simple steps:

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Test Locally (Right Now!)

The local server is already running. Open your browser and visit:

👉 **http://localhost:8000**

Browse the site and make sure everything looks good!

### Step 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages (10 minutes)

Open a new terminal and run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd c:\Cosmos\cosmos-graphic

# Initialize git (if not done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Azure Cosmos DB Visual Storybook"
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `cosmos-graphic`
3. Make it **PUBLIC** (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. Don't add README, .gitignore, or license (we have them)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 4: Push Your Code

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cosmos-graphic.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. Click **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under "Source":
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 6: Wait & Visit

- Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub to build your site
- You'll see: "Your site is published at https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/cosmos-graphic/"
- Click the link and enjoy your live site! 🎉
